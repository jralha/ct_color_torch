# ct_color_torch

Implementation of [fast neural style](https://github.com/jcjohnson/fast-neural-style) towards ct scan colorization.

Code not my own, only adapted from other repos, I unfortunately forgot which repos I took the code from, but shouldn't be hard to track down.

Largely deprecated as CycleGan [results](https://github.com/jralha/ct_color_gan) were vastly superior.
